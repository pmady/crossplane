I'm a DevOps/Platform Engineer passionate about cloud-native technologies and open source.

## 🔧 Currently Working With

- **Kubernetes** - Container orchestration and cluster management

## 🤖 Interests

I'm particularly enthusiastic about the intersection of **AI and Kubernetes** - projects that bring machine learning workloads to cloud-native infrastructure.

If you're working on something interesting in the cloud-native or AI/ML space, I'd love to hear about it! Feel free to:

- Open an issue or discussion on any of my repos
